## Task 1 (Creating Directory Structure)

With the help of mkdir -p command we can create sub-directories of a directory. It will create parent directory first, if it doesn't exist.

```\
mkdir -p A/{B/{D/{I/M/Z,J/L/Z},E/H/L/Z},C/{F/H/L/Z,G/K/L/Z}}
```
Further, tree command is used to list the directory structure.
